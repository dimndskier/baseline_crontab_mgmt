#Summary: This script checks who is logged in then compares that list to the kdecache directories in /tmp.  If the user is not currently logged in, than the associated kdecache directory is purged

#Variable declaration.
#number of users currently logged in
numusers=`who | cut -f 1 -d " " | sort -u | wc -l`
#number of directories found in /tmp
numdirs=`find /tmp/ -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'kdecache-*' -print | wc -l`
#places each logged in user as a string into an array
userstore=( $(who | cut -f 1 -d " " | sort -u) ) 
#places each found directory as a string into an array
dirstore=( $(find /tmp/ -maxdepth 1 -type d -name 'kdecache-*') )

#Runs through each user one by one and checks if they match a directory.  If so, that directory is removed from the directory array.
